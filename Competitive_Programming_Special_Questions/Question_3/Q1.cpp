    Q. Problem Statement
            Klaus thinks that he is a genius. Antonio wants to test Klausâ€™s IQ for that he asked him a problem.
            Given an array A of size N and an integer, K. Antonio asked Klaus to divide array A into K nonempty subsequence. Such that each element of the array should be part of exactly one subsequence. Now the Goodness of this division will be equal to
            Example:- For array A {2,4,3,6,1} dividing this array into two subsequence {2,4,1} and {3,6} the the Goodness of this division will be =(4-1)+(6-3)= 6.
            Now Antonion wants the goodness of the division to be the maximum possible.
            You have to help Klaus So that he remains a genius in front of Antonio.
            Your task is to determine the Maximum value of Goodness of the division.
        
        Note:-
        A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
        
        Input Format
            The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.
            The second line contains N space-separated integers, the array A.
        
        Output Format
            Print the maximum value of Goodness of the division.

        Constraints
            1<=K<=N<=105
            1<=A[i]<=109
        
        Sample Input 1
            6 2
            2 4 3 6 1 3
        
        Sample Output 1
            7

        Explanation of Sample 1
            For test case 1
            For getting maximum goodness one of the possible division is {2,4,3}, {6,1,3}
            And goodness = (4-2)+(6-1)=7
